Uses Viu https://github.com/atanunq/viu


To use: Open up KoboldAI and load a model.
Start terminalbot from terminal with "python terminalbot.py" and text generation will work.

If you want to use /draw you'll need to open up Stable Diffusion with --api and load a model then terminalbot will be able to make requests to it
